## Project Description: (for now)
This app is designed for readers that intend on tracking the progress of books theyâ€™ve read, as well as helping the user incorportate reading into their daily routine. This app would elevate the reading experience by adding mood-based tracking, paragraph tracking, as well as user statistics. Additionally, a fun feature would be to incentivize the reading experience by adding badges to unlock by completing certain challenges.
