# PagePal: A Friend for Every Chapter

## Project Description: 
This app is designed for readers that intend on tracking the progress of books they’ve read, as well as helping the user incorportate reading into their daily routine by making it a more enjoyable experience. To accomplish this, the app would elevate the reading experience by adding *mood-based tracking, paragraph tracking, as well as user statistics* that would help give the user *personalized recommendations*. 
Additionally, a fun feature to include would be to incentivize the reading experience by **adding badges** to unlock by completing certain challenges. An example would be an **"Early Bird" badge that users could earn by reading within the early hours of the day.**

## Similar Existing Solutions
1. [Goodreads][1] (primary)

    **Goodreads** is a popular website used amongst readers to log the books they’ve read, want to read, find recommendations, and share thoughts and reviews with friends and other readers.

    I’ve used Goodreads for quite some time, and it doesn’t exactly hit every checkmark I need in a book tracking app. It has some general things I want to implement, such as logging books, finding recommendations, and reviewing books with friends. However, when making recommendations, there is not an option to give half stars, so I would like to change that detail for sure.

    ![Rating - Goodreads](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Goodreads Ratings.png">)

    Additionally, there is a feature I really like that has a tab to display the users' "bookshelf":

    ![My books - Goodreads](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot 2025-09-09 123946.png">)

    This is great feature for organization purposes-- the user would be able to find their bookshelves that fit into a certain category, such as a "favorites" shelf, or a "Currently Reading" shelf.

2. [Bookly][2] (primary)

    **Bookly** is primarily used for staying motivated and keeping a consistent routine when reading. Additionally, users can keep a catalog of all the books they’ve read. Using personalized statistics, the app elevates the reading experience.

    ![Stats - Bookly](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Bookly Stats.png">)

    I used to own this app, which inspired the vision for creating my own. Overall, I love the idea of an app helping a user with creating routines—which is something I want my app to include. User statistics are great for the user, and also for the app to help create a personalized experience. I want my app to be a seamless, stress free experience to set goals and reach reading milestones.

    ![Main Screen - Bookly](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Bookly Main Screen.png">)

    This shows the main layout, where the user has many options to choose from. Doing something like this would make the app easy to navigate in order to enjoy all the features within the app. 

3.	[The StoryGraph][3] (Primary)

    TheStoryGraph is a good app for **reading tracking, as well as a tool to help find your next read.** This app relies heavily on statistics to see how the user’s reading develops over time to help the user pick books based on their statistics.

    ![TheStoryGraph - Statistics](<"/workspaces/HC26-Collins-Vivian-Senior-Project/docs/screenshots/TheStoryGraph - Stats.png">)
    
    Another feature includes a catalog of books that users can search through by specific keywords to find their perfect next read.

    ![TheStoryGraph - keywords](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\TheStoryGraph - keywords.png">)

    This app has a lot that I love about it. This is the closest app to my vision, as it includes statistics, reviews and recommendations, and a friend system. I think one of the few things it lacks is an incentive to reading. In my app, I want to incentivize this process by adding a badge feature to earn as the user progresses through their reading journey.

4. [Bookmory][4] (Secondary)

    Bookmory is another reading tracker that offers book registration via search and barcode, page and time tracking, book genre organization, a reading calendar, notes, reviews, and a goal setting. These statistics and features help elevate the reading experience.

    ![Bookmory - Main Page](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Bookmory - Main Page.png">)

    ![Bookmory - Stats](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Bookmory - Main Page.png">)

    There’s a lot of similarities between my vision and what Bookmory has to offer. I like that there is a book registration feature, so if there’s a way for me to add that, it would be really nice to have. 

5.	[Fable][5] (Primary)
    Fable is a unique reading app that creates a community of readers within the app. Users can join *user-created book clubs, import books and discuss them in-app along with other users.* 
    
    ![Fable - Features](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Fable - features.png">)

    The goal of Fable is to make reading more *social and enjoyable* for users—which is fairly similar to the goal of my project as well.

    ![Fable - Socials](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Fable - Socials.png">)

    I really like the idea of book clubs, which is something I could consider if I have the time for it. I feel as if it would be good for community engagement. Sometimes it is nice to be able to read alongside other users if they are unable to attend an in-person book club. This is definitely something I will consider if I have the time to do it.

6.	[Literal.club][6] (Primary)
    Literal.club is an app designed to track what you’re reading, connect with friends, and also join in-app book clubs to engage with the reading community. 
    
    ![Literal - Book Clubs](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Literal - Book Clubs.png">)

    Some additional features include setting individual reading goals, organize your personal library, creating highlights and notes.

    ![Literal - Features](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\Literal - Features.png">)

    Like Fable, Literal.club’s book clubs are a cool feature that I won’t prioritize but would be a nice feature. Something similar would be that I plan on including in-app goals that readers can set, as I believe setting a goal can lead to a successful reading habit. 

7.	[LibraryThing][7] (Primary)
    LibraryThing is a free-to-use website where users can add books, movies, and music, among other imports from libraries, to track, rate, and review books. 

    ![LibraryThing - Adds and Reviews](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\LibraryThing - adds and reviews.png">)
    
    Additionally, users can join groups and discuss the forms of media with other users, along with the ability to see detailed statistics about the users’ library and reading journey.

    ![LibraryThing - Groups](<"C:\Users\vivia\OneDrive - Hanover College\Pictures\Screenshots\LibraryThing - Groups.png">)

    I like what the website has to offer, as it offers statistics, recommendations, and overall personalizations based on what the user has read and reviewed. This is what I want to do, but I want to make it more fun for the user.

# Technologies

## Platform
- Mobile app

## Programming Languages
- Kotlin (Definite)
    - Essential for Mobile App Development. Can also be used for multiplatform development-- which I will be aiming for whilst utilizing Kotlin Multiplatform. (see below) It is very flexible and I am more familiar with it. 

Other options explored:
- JavaScript
    - Used for creating interactive and dynamic elements—very versatile.
- C++
    - Good for multiplatform development. Often used for backend systems and embedded applications.

### Kotlin Multiplatform

A technology that allows you to write code once and then reuse it anywhere. KMP supports various operating systems, such as Andriod and IOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux. Paired with Compose Multiplatform, I can at least get the bare minimum of what I need to successfully build this app.

## Frameworks or Libraries
-	Frameworks (a library that offers the required fundamental structure to create mobile applications for a specific environment, i.e., a layout.)
    - Compose Multiplatform
        - UI framework by Jetbrains-- smooth scrolling, responsive text editing, and platform-specific gesture support. Can easily access native APIs

-   Libraries (a collection of pre-written code or functions that developers can use to build applications.)
    - SQLDelight
        - Database library for structured local storage
        - Easy schema managament
    - Ktor
        - Can be used to integrate external services, such as the Google Books API, Open Library API
