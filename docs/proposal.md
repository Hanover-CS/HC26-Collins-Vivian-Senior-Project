## 10 word summary
Building a community of readers seeking to enhance their reading experience.
## Project Description: (for now)
This app is designed for readers that intend on tracking the progress of books they’ve read, as well as helping the user incorportate reading into their daily routine. This app would elevate the reading experience by adding mood-based tracking, paragraph tracking, as well as user statistics. Additionally, a fun feature would be to incentivize the reading experience by adding badges to unlock by completing certain challenges.

## Similar Existing Solutions
1. [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) (primary)

Goodreads is a popular website used amongst readers to log the books they’ve read, want to read, find recommendations, and share thoughts and reviews with friends and other readers. 

I’ve used Goodreads for quite some time, and it doesn’t exactly hit every checkmark I need in a book tracking app. It has some general things I want to implement, such as logging books, finding recommendations, and reviewing books with friends. However, when making recommendations, there is not an option to give half stars, so I would like to change that detail for sure.

2.	[Bookly](https://getbookly.com/) (primary)

Bookly is primarily used for staying motivated and keeping a consistent routine when reading. Additionally, users can keep a catalog of all the books they’ve read. Using personalized statistics, the app elevates the reading experience.

I used to own this app, which inspired my vision for creating my own. Overall, I love the idea of an app helping a user with creating routines—which is something I want my app to include. User statistics are great for the user, and also for the app to help create a personalized experience. I want my app to be a seamless, stress free experience to set goals and reach reading milestones.

3.	[The StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com/) (Primary)

TheStoryGraph is a good app for reading tracking, as well as a tool to help find your next read. This app relies heavily on statistics to see how the user’s reading develops over time to help the user pick books based on their statistics. Another feature includes a catalog of books that users can search through by specific keywords to find their perfect next read.

This app has a lot that I love about it. This is the closest app to my vision, as it includes statistics, reviews and recommendations, and a friend system. I think one of the few things it lacks is an incentive to reading. In my app, I want to incentivize this process by adding a badge feature to earn as the user progresses through their reading journey.

4. [Bookmory](https://bookmory-reading-tracker.en.softonic.com/android?ex=RAMP-3538.0&rex=true) (Secondary)

Bookmory is another reading tracker that offers book registration via search and barcode, page and time tracking, book genre organization, a reading calendar, notes, reviews, and a goal setting. These statistics and features help elevate the reading experience.

There’s a lot of similarities between my vision and what Bookmory has to offer. I like that there is a book registration feature, so if there’s a way for me to add that, it would be really nice to have. 

5.	[Fable](https://fable.co/interactive-reading) (Primary)
Fable is a unique reading app that creates a community of readers within the app. Users can join user-created book clubs, import books and discuss them in-app along with other users. The goal of Fable is to make reading more social and enjoyable for users—which is fairly similar to the goal of my project as well.

I really like the idea of book clubs, which is something I could consider if I have the time for it. I feel as if it would be good for community engagement

6.	[Literal.club](https://literal.club/) (Primary)
Literal.club is an app designed to track what you’re reading, connect with friends, and also join in-app book clubs to engage with the reading community. Some additional features include setting individual reading goals, organize your personal library, creating highlights and notes.

Like Fable, Literal.club’s book clubs are a cool feature that I won’t prioritize but would be a nice feature. (Work in progress)

7.	[LibraryThing LibraryThing](https://www.librarything.com/) (Primary)
LibraryThing is a free-to-use website where users can add books, movies, and music, among other imports from libraries, to track, rate, and review books. Additionally, users can join groups and discuss the forms of media with other users, along with the ability to see detailed statistics about the users’ library and reading journey.

- JavaScript
    - Used for creating interactive and dynamic elements—very versatile.
- C++
    - Good for multiplatform development. Often used for backend systems and embedded applications.
